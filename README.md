# Module 18 Challenge: Tableau

## citibike_trip_history

In this challenge, I utilized Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook to merge and clean Citi Bike trip data from January 2023 and January 2024. After creating a merged DataFrame, I saved it as a CSV file and imported it into Tableau for visualization.

## Key Findings

- **Bike Usage**: Classic bikes were the most popular choice, with longer ride durations compared to electric bikes, which, despite their shorter ride times, offer faster travel.
- **Popular Days**: Wednesdays and Tuesdays saw the highest number of rides, while weekends, particularly Sundays, had the fewest.
- **Top Bike Stations**: Some of the busiest stations for both starting and ending rides are:
  - Ave A & E 14 St
  - W 41 St & 8 Ave
  - W 21 St & 6 Ave
  - 1 Ave & E 68 St
  - 8 Ave & W 31 St

## Tableau Visualizations

In Tableau, I created several visualizations to highlight these insights:

1. **Bar Charts**: Displayed the ride count for different bike types and popular stations.
2. **Time Series Plots**: Illustrated ride patterns over the two-month period to identify trends and peak usage times.
3. **Interactive Maps**: Provided detailed views of bike station locations, allowing exploration of station usage trends for January 2023 and January 2024.

Feel free to use the filters to explore distinctions between casual users and members. The interactive map offers insights into bike station usage across New York City for both months.
